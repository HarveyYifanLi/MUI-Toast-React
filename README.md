### MUI-Toast-React
This is a cute React prject where I experimented with the idea of displaying a responsive `Toast Notification` on the UI upon (fake) Server triggers/messagings.
The main technologies that I used include `MUI` and `React`, with `Redux` for global state management on the UI.

### Steps for execution
Simply clone and `cd` into the repo and then do '`npm install`' followed by '`npm start`'.
